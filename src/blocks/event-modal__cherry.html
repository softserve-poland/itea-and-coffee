      <div class="full-event__topic"><mark>&mdash; </mark>DevOps, where Dev and Test get along with</div>
      <div class="full-event__topic-content"><mark>Michał Buczko</mark> His "Business as Usual" is varied and exciting. Michał is a part of a Dev feature team in NewVoiceMedia family where he is the advocate for great and efficient testing. He gives his insight into design of the features, the definition of the scope of testing. Michał works with Developers to create automated tests for their Continuous Integration and Delivery platform. In addition, he explores the features and products, supports regression and releases and expands his knowledge to be able to improve all everyday stuff. He takes his self-learning seriously, shares "new-fancy stuff" with others and helps team members grow as individuals. In the future, Michał wants to become a champion of good testing and provide support to all functions which directly interact with their customers. To achieve that he is allowed and expected to challenge assumptions and suggest different ways of working/testing. In his free time Michał is encouraged by the organization to share their experience and tries his best to take his public speaking hobby into a whole new, professional level.</div>
      <div class="full-event__topic-content">Have you ever considered how a duo of a tester and programmer can change the workflow in your project? Michał will show you how such duos worked well in DevOps environment in NewVoiceMedia, where he manages the parallel requirements, the operations
      must be compliant with PCI DSS standard and the deployment process requires the cooperation of many teams. The method proposed by Michał may be beneficial in both agile and waterfall methods — no matter if the team is working in one room or if it's located across several continents. How to create and keep a common goal for the entire team? What are the advantages of using pair programming? You will find answers to these questions during the lecture.</div>
