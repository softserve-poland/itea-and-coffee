      <div class="full-event__topic-content"><mark>Agata </mark> Agata is a Resource Manager at SoftServe with 5 years of professional experience in talent acquisition within IT sector. Psychology graduate with strong interest in human relations and personal development. Travel enthusiast and a book-lover.
      She likes to challenge herself by giving presentations from time to time.</div>
      <div class="full-event__topic-content">Do you consider public speaking a challenge? Do you read guide books on “how to rock your next presentation” while the question “how to survive your next presentation” would be far more accurate? Mark Twain once said: 'There are two types of speakers
      - those that are nervous and those that are liars'. I would like to convince you that while you should take great care
      of preparing content and design, delivery – the third inseparable part of every presentation – is actually the most
      important one. This speech is also meant to show you a dialogue as a great way to deliver a presentation… without passing
      out.</div>
